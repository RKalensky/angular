        "description": "When faced with the question of which is the best-selling phone, most of you probably think 'iPhone'. Hehe! Not even close! Although Apple's crown jewel does sell in cosmic quantities, the iPhone 6 having sold 71.5 million units in about three months, this lucky champ has nothing going on the Nokia 1100. The Nokia 1100 is an entry level basic handset which hit the market in late 2003. It didn't have two front cameras or a curved screen, but it did have a torch light, a pair of no-slip grips, and a dust-proof case. A classic Nokia badass that the then thriving Finns designed for the growing Chinese market and other regions that smelled of cash!"

A phone that matches any flagship on specs and premieres the latest OS version, but costs barely half as much as some of them. The Nexus 5 promises a great finale to yet another exciting smartphone season and it's not only the droids that stand to attention."

After all, if the Robin in Sony's IFA lineup can do that well, we can only imagine what Batman is capable of. The Z3 is certainly one you wouldn't want to miss."

The main camera now uses a 12MP sensor capable of 4K video recording as well as 1080p at 120fps, there is a brand new 5MP selfie camera too. And, it's the same screen size and resolution but we think it's exactly what Apple meant with 'the only thing that's changed is everything'."
